        <h2> Our History</h2>
<p> Since opening in 1991, Smiling Youth has grown from a single food van delivering meals to young homeless people on the streets of Kings Cross to a major youth specific agency offering a full continuum of care through delivery of a wide range of services.
</p>
Our 35 services include aboriginal programs, crisis accommodation, alcohol and other drug services, counselling, accredited high schools, outreach and residential programs. Volunteers support us every step of the way.
<p> Smiling youth was accredited as a Designated Agency for Out of Home Care and maintains policies and procedures that comply with the benchmark standards as defined by the Office of the Children’s Guardian.
