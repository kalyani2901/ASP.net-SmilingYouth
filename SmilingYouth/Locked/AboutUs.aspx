        <h1>About Us </h1>
        <p>
             Smiling youth is a non-denominational community organisation working for disadvantaged young people who may be homeless, drug dependent and/or recovering from abuse. Our organization supports these young people as they work to turn their lives around and overcome immense personal trauma such as neglect, physical, psychological and/or emotional abuse.
It is our goal that these young people will leave our care drug free, with a high school education, living skills and a full-time or part time job in hand.
        </p>
        Our goal is to see that no young person is denied the right to education, safe accommodation, drug and alcohol rehabilitation, counselling and other support services aimed at breaking the cycle of disadvantage, abuse and neglect.
        <p>
            There is self discovery, development of skill, growth and education for young people involved in our programs and services.</p>
            <p>Smiling youth empowers young people to participate in and transform their future through the development of their skills, confidence and relationships with each other, their families and their communities.</p>
